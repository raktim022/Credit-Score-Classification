# Credit-Score-Classification
 ##Given a personâ€™s credit-related information, build a machine learning model that can classify the credit score into *Good*, *Standard* and *Poor*
.There were two parts to the above task:
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Model Building and Training

The first step of EDA was Data Preprocessing, which included-
- **Dropping null values**
- **Dropping columns that are not relevant to prediction**
- **Removing duplicate entries**
